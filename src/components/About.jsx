          Hello, I&apos;m Aaditya Agarwal, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at IIT BHU. I&lsquo;m a software engineer who began my development journey in January 2024, driven by a passion for exploring the field. I enjoy creating new projects and delving into the Web. Alongside web development, I am also into competitive programming, as I love solving problems. In my free time, I play tennis and the guitar. I enjoy experimenting with various software and learning new skills; during school, I developed Tinkercad projects and used Photoshop for fun.
